# EBAZ4205-Daughter-Board
Simple daughter board for EBAZ4205 FPGA with VGA, PS2 and standard 2.54 header

Daughter board to add VGA and PS2 {keyboard, not playstation ;-)}  functionality to the EBAZ54205 miner board.
Also brings out IO pins to standard 2.54 header for easier interfacing.
All through hole for easy assembly

Notes:
PS2 needs 5v so a 12v needs to be taken to the 12v header +connector which feeds the 5v regulator, or a separate 5v source taken directly to the 5v header.
Design could be improved by bringing the 2mm headers neader the edge of the board but they still connect fine as they are
The 2 individual 16 pin 2.54 headers could be changed to a proper 2 x 16 pin header (they are currently spaced slightly too far apart for a 2x16 IDC connector)
